					<hr>
					<p>We pride ourselves in bringing salvation to the masses. This includes you!</p>
					<p>While there has been a lot of criticism from the ignorant masses, fear not, for we will reach true enlightment while the world remains dark. Our guides to this light are the Divine Catgirls.</p>
					<h3>What are Catgirls?</h3>
					<p>Catgirls, or rather Kemonomimi, are divine beings that have decided to bless our wretched world despite our natural tendency to sinning. Keep in mind that Komonomimi are not exclusively Catgirls (Nekomimi), but rather a broad term for all Divine Vessels. Despite mostly being regarded as fictional, our Founding Fathers have had the privileged right to be enlightened and informed of the true beauty and power of Kemonomimi.</p>
					<p>As such, the Founding Fathers established the Order of Neko to bring back light to this darkened realm.</p>
